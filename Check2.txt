The sound of rain tapping against the window was soothing, almost hypnotic. I sat in my favorite chair, watching droplets race down the glass as the storm raged on outside. I was grateful for the warmth of my home, the comfort of my surroundings. There was something comforting about being safe and dry inside while chaos reigned outside. It made me appreciate the little things, like a hot cup of tea and a good book, even more. As I settled in for the evening, I knew I would sleep soundly, content in the knowledge that I was exactly where I needed to be.
